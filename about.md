#### **About the products** 
We believe aviators need apps that are easy to
use, affordable, and work on a wide variety of affordable Android devices. 
All our apps are free, designed to run on nearly all Android devices, focus on
simplicity, contain no push ads, and require only non-invasive Permissions
required for functioning.

#### **About the development team**
Our team was founded in September of
2012 by engineer, Android developer, and pilot, **[Zubair Khan](http://zk4u.blogspot.com/ "Zubair's Blog")**.
He credits pilot friends John, Peter, Ron, and Tiberius as
co-founders. Our focus is on contributing to the aviation & coding
communities and having fun, so we've developed and continued to evolve
a [Philosophy and Guidelines](https://apps4av.net/site/about-2/philosophy/ "Philosophy").

In 2014, code had been developed to enable free geo-referenced FAA
Plates for IFR situational awareness. The initial work of manually
tagging and verifying coordinate points on the Plates was then taken
on by a **large group of volunteers**, too many to name
individually. Subsequently, the FAA began tagging plates for most
public airports and these FAA geo-referenced plates are now
included. (Plates for air force bases are generally not tagged by the
FAA.)

#### **About joining us**
We invite you to join the aviators and others supporting our free apps
with their time, expertise and financial contributions. To offer your
help with coding, publicity, or anything else please subscribe to our
[**Forum**](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/apps4av-forum "Apps4Av
Forum on Google Groups") and join the conversation.

Please contact us on our
[**Forum**](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apps4av-forum) if
you'd like to **volunteer your services**. We enjoy the fun and
fascination of developing and extending the apps, and there's a
special delight in sharing them freely with other aviators. The
complete Avare source code is available on
[Github](https://github.com/about "About GitHub") at this URL:
[http://github.com/apps4av/avare](http://github.com/apps4av/avare "Avare on GitHub")

#### **About Feedback & Requests**
We warmly welcome any and all **feedback, requests, suggestions or
questions** on our
**[Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apps4av-forum "Apps4Av Forum")**
about any of our products. Aviator and programmer questions and
feedback there help all our users and our all-volunteer development
team. Such feedback has helped us to continue rapidly improving Avare
and all our apps. Though we carefully test our code, it's possible that 
bugs may occasionally surface, and your feedback is crucial in our quick
corrective action. _**\*Please Note**_ that any negative feedback you may
share in an app store Review might discourage other pilots from trying
our products, so given that our apps are free and improving very rapidly we
hope you'll join us in **posting positive Google Play Store reviews**
encouraging pilots to try them out.

#### **About making a financial donation towards our expenses**
To learn more 
about contributing funds and how we use them, visit our
[**About Donations**](/donate.html "About Donations") page. To save

launch Avare, tap the **Map** tab, then the **Menu** button, then the
**Help** button.The two donate buttons are at the bottom of that

While we are an all-volunteer group, in order to provide the
protections and benefits of non-profit status for our users the Avare
team formed **Apps4Av, Inc.** as a registered 
[non-profit organization](http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSummary.aspx?FEIN=463956765 "Non-Profit Status") 
in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. For your convenient and secure

be appreciated.

code of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).** Note that you can
select a single donation **One Time Donation** you can optionally do
again for any amount at any time.  If you choose an ongoing **Periodic

the One Time Donation process, helps us to plan our budget
expenditures based on income, and still allows you to easily cancel or

We appreciate you taking the time to consider donating funds to help with our costs.

_Thank you!_

#### **About Donating or temporarily Loaning Hardware**
As part of our mission to provide affordable resources for aviators,
we're actively developing ADS-B solutions for Avare. You can help by
**loaning or donating** your company or personal ADS-B receiver so 
that we can add it to the list of devices supported by Avare.
