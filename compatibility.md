Below is an incomplete list of external GPS & ADSB devices known to be
compatible with Avare. Most standardized devices work well with Avare,
but this list of tested devices may be helpful to review for choosing a device. 
Many other devices beyond those listed below that are designed using
industry standards might work perfectly with Avare but have not yet
been reported or tested. Please contact us if you'd like us to add to
the list a device you know is compatible. OEMs are also invited to
contact us about adding their devices. **Note** that this list may be out of date, and
vendors may change their hardware designs making them incompatible.
