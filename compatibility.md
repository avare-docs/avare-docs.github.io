Below is an incomplete list of external GPS & ADSB devices known to be
compatible with Avare. Most standardized devices (i.e., those based on
[GDL-90](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/adsb/Archival/media/GDL90_Public_ICD_RevA.PDF))
work well with Avare, but this list of tested devices may be helpful
for choosing a device.  Many other devices using GDL-90 might work
with Avare, but have not yet been reported.
